      Chapter 2: My First Real Web App
    </h1>

    <p class="blog-subtitle2">
      This Spring I decided to take some time off of school to do something I have always wanted to do. Be a web developer.
      I don't know what it is about this field that seems so different to me than traditional programming. There's just something so
      magical and enticing about it. It's difficult to describe. I started out learning basic Java in...

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just released my first real, solo web app onto the internet today and I am really happy about it. It took a lot of work,
  a lot of research, and a lot of hours, but I am very proud to have something that I can share with the rest of the world. I
  wanted to just take some time and discuss things I learned and mistakes I made while building this site. If you have some time,
  check it out at <%= link_to "www.thememekitchen.com", "http://www.thememekitchen.com" %>.<br>

  <br><br><b>What is it?</b>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Meme Kitchen is a cute little meme site idea that I came up with a couple of months ago.
  The website is set up like a restaurant, but instead of serving food, customers get served up some spicy memes. When you
  are looking at memes, you are a customer, but you can also become a meme chef. You can get in the kitchen and make your own
  meme dishes and share them with the public. Each "dish" has a title and an optional caption with an option to upload an image
  or gif. The process is easy, fast, and your memes go straight out to the public for everyone to see!<br>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make a new meme, your dish is automatically sent out to the "Buffet" page. This is a feed
  of every single post that has been made by all users. It is constantly being updated with the newest posts and when the site
  reaches a certain critical amount of users this page will be a virtually endless feed of memes.<br>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other main feed on the website is known as the "Main Course" feed. This is where the best of
  the best dishes are served to customers. These memes are chosen by Meme Kitchen Admins and are immediately shown on the main
  course feed when they are selected. They are added to the top of list. Just like in the buffet, the newst additions are shown
  first.<br>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other features of the site include having your own profile with all of the dishes you've made,
  being able to like/dislike any post, being able to "Review Dishes" by posting comments on posts, a subscription system where
  you are able to subscribe to other chefs to view their memes, and even a notification system to let you know when someone has
  liked your meme or commented about your dish. Most of these features, including the feeds, are implemented using javascript
  and ajax technology which allows the app to feel more dynamic and similar to a single page application.<br>

  <br><br><b>How was it built?</b>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back-end of my site and application as a whole is implemented using Ruby on Rails 5. My app is hosted on Heroku and is
  currently up running on paid Hobby Dynos. I use PostgreSQL for my back-end production database - This allows my app to deploy easily
  with Heroku (I really want to check out MongoDB in a future project though. Maybe when I get into some Node JS). [My database logic
  consists of a few resources/models - the main ones being User, Post, and Comment and some smaller more specific ones like
  Notification or Following/Followers (Allows users to sub to each other)]. I used Rail's default testing for my application, but
  when I get the chance I will be swapping over to RSpec and hopefully using some Cucumber as well.
  Finally, I use the Carrierwave gem in order to upload my images to my website and everything is stored on an S3 bucket, managed by an
  account I have set up with the Amazon Web Services Cloud. It's a bit of a lengthy set up but it works well. <br>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front-end of my site is built using a combination of Javascript, jquery, Sassy CSS,
  HTML5, and some Twitter bootstrap. I wanted my site to be dynamic and respond without overbearing server requests so I tried
  to implement AJAX functionality into a lot of my site. It took a while to learn how to implement AJAX with Ruby on Rails, but
  once I figured it out, it was a breeze to use. Although, there is apparently some other thing in Rails called Turbolinks that
  is apparently some type of super ajax? I didn't read about them until recently, but I would love a chance to get to use them
  in a future project.<br>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also some miscellaneous information,
  I purchased my domain name from Namecheap.com and they provide a pretty good DNS service. It was also fairly simple to redirect
  any traffic to heroku. I used a free SSL provider from a website called 'lets encrypt' which allowed me to provide a secure,
  encrypted connection for my users using a tool called Certbot. I was able to place my site on Google's index and add Google
  Analytics fairly quickly.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a lot more detailed work and more things that I could talk about, but I just wanted to
